A weirdness calculator made with React and Redux

INSTALL:

Before starting this project, I had only used redux once. I learned it when I was learning React, but only on the very surface level. This project was a great learning experience. 

As you can see, I added react-router very late in the project. I did not fully understand the Redux file structure when I started, so I did not organize it very well. I hope that the final product reflects everything that I have learned about redux. I know that there is still a lot that could be done to improve this app.

- Make the enter button submit the search
- Split the ducks folder into each component folder
- Style the app a little better
- Fix routing so that it works on Github Pages (not a requirement, but I had the app deployed for my parents to see, and the routing broke it)

If I could do this project over, I would definitely do it differently. I would apply everything that I learned on my first run through the project, and I think that the code would be a bit more organized.
